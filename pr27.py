# The next logical step is to deal with handling user input.
#  When a player (say player 1, who is X) wants to place an X on the screen,
#  they canâ€™t just click on a terminal. So we are going to approximate this clicking simply by
#  asking the user for a coordinate of where they want to place their piece.
