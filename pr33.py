# For this exercise, we will keep track of when our friendâ€™s birthdays are, and
# be able to find that information based on their name.
# Create a dictionary (in your file) of names and birthdays.
# When you run your program it should ask the user to enter a name, and return
# the birthday of that person back to them.
# The interaction should look something like this:

# >>> Welcome to the birthday dictionary. We know the birthdays of:
# Albert Einstein
# Benjamin Franklin
# Ada Lovelace
# >>> Who's birthday do you want to look up?
# Benjamin Franklin
# >>> Benjamin Franklin's birthday is 01/17/1706.
