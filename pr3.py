# Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number.
# (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

num = int(input("Enter number to find divisors: "))
i=1
divisors=[]
while i<num:
    if (num % i) == 0:
        divisors.append(i)
    i+=1
print("Divisors of %d are: %s" %(num,divisors))
